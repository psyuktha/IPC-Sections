# Indian Penal Court (IPC) Setions predictor

## Overview

This project is an implementation of a Neural network for the identification of suitable IPC section from offense as an input. The project is hosted on Google Colab and involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

`IPC.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
## Requirements

-  Python
-  Numpy
-  Sklearn
-  Kaggle dataset

### Data Preparation

- Download the [Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections Information](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dev523/indian-penal-code-ipc-sections-information)
- Upload the dataset to your Google Drive.
- Open the bodyparts.ipynb notebook in Google Colab and ensure that it's connected to your Google Drive.

Run the notebook step by step for data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps in the notebook include:

- Loading the dataset from Google Drive.
- Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- Model
  
## Training

The training section includes:

1. Model compilation and configuration.
2. Training the model on the training dataset.
3. Monitoring training progress and visualizing metrics.
4. Prediction

After model training, predictions are performed on both the validation and test datasets.
